v1.5    2015-09-20

- html_fancy overview page can now be viewed locally (through file:///) without
  needing to specify the -p local_js=1 flag to it. It still fetches resources

  want to fetch resources from the internet, use the -p local_js=1 flag.

  that directory are interpreted as one big hosts file.

  view the hosts overview in your browser using file://. See README.md for info
  on how to enable it (hint: `ansible-cmdb -p local_js=1`).
- Add -f/--fact-caching flag for compatibility with fact_caching=jsonfile fact
  dirs (Rowin Andruscavage).
- The search box in the html_fancy template is now automatically focussed.
