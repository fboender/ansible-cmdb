About
-----

Ansible-cmdb takes the output of Ansible's fact gathering and converts it into
a static HTML overview page (and other things) containing system configuration
information.

It supports multiple types of output (html, csv, sql, etc) and extending
information gathered by Ansible with custom data. For each host it also shows
the groups, host variables, custom variables and machine-local facts.
