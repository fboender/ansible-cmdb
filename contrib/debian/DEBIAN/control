Description: Generate host overview from Ansible 'setup' module output
 ansible-cmdb takes the output of Ansible's 'setup' module output (fact
 gathering) and transforms it into an host information overview. It supports
 supplementing gathered information with your own information. It can also scan
 the ansible 'hosts' file to get groups and variables to be included in the
 host information overview.
