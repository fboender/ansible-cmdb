# Contributions

If you wish to contribute code, please consider the following:

* Code should be reasonably PEP8-like. I'm not too strict on this.
* One logical change per merge request.
* By putting in a merge request or putting code in comments, you automatically
  grant me permission to include this code in ansible-cmdb under the license
  (GPLv3) that ansible-cmdb uses. The copyright for contributed code is
  retained by the contributor.
* Please don't be disappointed or angry if your contributions end up unused.
  It's not that they aren't appreciated, but I can be somewhat strict when it
  comes to code quality, feature creep, etc.

When in doubt, just open a pull request and post a comment on what you're
unclear of, and we'll figure it out.

# Inner workings

Here's a quick introduction on how ansible-cmdb works internally.

1. The main section in `ansible-cmdb` reads the commandline params and
   instantiates an `Ansible` object.
1. The `Ansible` object first reads in all the facts by calling
   `Ansible.parse_fact_dir()` for each argument. This includes the user-extended
   facts.
1. If hosts file(s) should be parsed (`-i` option), ansible calls
   `Ansible.parse_hosts_inventory()`. This first reads in all found hosts files
   into one big string, and then it parses it. For this it uses the
   `AnsibleHostParser` class.
1. The `AnsibleHostParser` class first parses the inventory and then creates a
   dictionary with all known ansible node names (hosts) as the keys, but with
   empty values. It then goes through the 'children', 'vars' and normal
   sections from the inventory and applies the found information to the hosts
   dictionary.
1. When `AnsibleHostParser` is done, the `Ansible` class takes all the parsed
   hosts information and updates its own version of the hosts dictionary.
1. Finally, the output is generated by the main section.

Updating a host in the `Ansible` object is done using the `Ansible.update_host`
method. This method does a deep-update of a dictionary. This lets ansible-cmdb
overlay information from the facts dir, extended / manual facts and hosts 
inventory files.

# Running from the git repo

If you want to run ansible-cmdb directly from the Git repo:

    $ cd ansible-cmdb
    $ export PYTHONPATH="$(readlink -f lib)"
    $ src/ansible-cmdb

# Building

## Make targets

For building, `make` is used. Here are some useful targets:

* `make test`: build some tests.
* `make release`: build a release.
* `make clean`: remove build and other artifacts.

## Build packages and source-ball

To build Debian, RedHat and source-packages for ansible-cmdb you'll need a
Debian based operating system and you'll have to install the following
dependencies:

- git
- make
- python-markdown
- zip
- fakeroot
- alien
- Python 'wheel' package

You can then build the packages with

    make release REL_VERSION=$VERSION

where `$VERSION` is a (arbitrary) version number.

In order to build releases, your repository will have to be completely clean:
everything must be commited and there must be no untracked files. If you want
to build a test release, you can temporary stash your untracked changes:

    git stash -u

# History

Ansible-cmdb started as a short Python script, which I [blogged
about](http://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2015/01/21/host-inventory-overview-using-ansibles-facts/).

[Cris van Pelt](https://melkfl.es/) then took that and expanded it into a HTML
page. Eventually I forked it to Github and made it public, adding features.
[Many people collaborated](https://github.com/fboender/ansible-cmdb/graphs/contributors) to
make Ansible-cmdb into what it is today.
